#### About this project: 
This project was made as a school project to try out building or own: front end, web API and MVC. Since this assigment was a part of an backend course - please note that because of a lack of time and because of it not being a requirement, very little effort has been put into the frontend and the design. **This webpage is merely as a prototype to showcase my backend code and is not meant as a finnished product. **

#### API's used:

* [Oxford Cognitive Services - Face API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-apii) for face recognition data. 

#### Technologies used: 
* **C#/ ASP.NET** for webAPI and communication with Oxford API. 
* **HTML** structure and content.
* **CSS** for layout and desiggn.
* **Jquery** for effects and functionality. 

#### How to use this service ####
Find the URL to a picture you would like analyzed, put the address into the search field and click "send".
The service will return age and gender for the picture. It will also mark out where the head, eyes, the nose and mouth of the person are.  Marking out the facial landmarks works the best when the picture is smaller than: 1600 x 600. The picture is also preferebly taken from straight ahead (and not from an angle). Finding more than one person in the same picture is at this time not implemented.
This webbsite has only been tested out on Chrome at 1920x1080.
